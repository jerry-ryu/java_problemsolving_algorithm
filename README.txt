README.txt

This repository is for java problem solving and learning algorithms.
I usually solve problems at "www.programmers.com" and someday I'll commence looking about problems in "baekjoon" and "leetcode"
In addition, I'm learning gramma, algorithms, and data structure in JAVA to become a skillful developer.
This repository is just a first step for me.
