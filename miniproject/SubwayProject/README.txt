<Subway Mini Project>
This project starts on 21/05/23 to implement a program that provides information about subway station 
and calculate minimum time for one station to another considering Transfer station.

I'm going to use public data related to subway arrivals/department schedules and subway station information like address and surroundings.

The Essential elements and necessary algorithms of this project
1. Dijkstra algorithm
2. Search algorithm
3. Accessible DB
